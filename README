This is a php library designed to be used with the Codeigniter framework.

This library is based off of the work found here http://blog.michaelhelmick.com/2010/07/30/freshbooks-api-using-oauth/ by Mike Helmick. The codebase as changed to work within the Codeignitor http://codeigniter.com library format. Also a controller class was added to demo the use of this library.

To install:

- copy the files to their respective homes; config, controllers, and libraries.

- Modify config.php with your relevant information.

- Run the login method of the Freshbooks controller. 

- To set a different sub domain from your consumer key use the $this->freshbooks_oauth->set_namespace('xxxxxxx'); See the constructor of freshbooks.php

Get Data Calls:

Currently we do not support all the different calls to FreshBooks but we do have a handful to work from. In Freshbooks_oauth.php if you scroll to the comment section "Helper functions to get different datasets" you will be able to add or modify function calls to meet your data needs.

- $this->freshbooks_oauth->get_categories()
- $this->freshbooks_oauth->get_expenses()
- $this->freshbooks_oauth->get_payments()
- $this->freshbooks_oauth->get_customers()
