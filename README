This is a php library designed to be used with the Codeigniter framework.

This library is based off of the work found here http://blog.michaelhelmick.com/2010/07/30/freshbooks-api-using-oauth/ by Mike Helmick. The codebase as changed to work within the Codeignitor http://codeigniter.com library format. Also a controller class was added to demo the use of this library.

To install:

- copy the files to their respective homes; config, controllers, and libraries.

- Modify config.php with your relevant information.

- Run the login method of the Freshbooks controller.
